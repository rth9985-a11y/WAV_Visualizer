# WAV_Visualizer
#
### This program Plots audio data (bytes) to over time (sec) in using Matplotlib and Numpy
### WAV_Visualizer is a static program and plots the entire files audio data
### This is not a real time visualizer
#
# Use:
## * Run the program and enter file name in the console
## * File must be in program file or formatted as to/this/directory/fileName.wav
#
# Note:
## * File type must be WAV
## * Can be any type of WAV but it opened with the 'wave' library so MP3s will not work
## * Numpy, Matplotlib, and Wave libraries must be installed to run
#
# In the future!!!
## Will expand to make this a real time application
## Will expand with GUI instead of a console applicaiton
## This is a Matplotlib, Numpy, and audio programming exercise for me!!!
